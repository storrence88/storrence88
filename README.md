## Sup! âŒ‘

I am a full-time Ruby on Rails developer living in Dallas. I work as an engineer at Cratebind, a digital product agency partnering with consumer brands to build smart, simple and beautiful technology. I'm also learning React.js in an effort to level up my front end game!

I love learning new things and challenging myself all the while sharing my experiences and meeting new people along the way!
